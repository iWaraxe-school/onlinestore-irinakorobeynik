# 2. Maven (EN)
## Task #2
Before starting the implementation of `OnlineStore,` we need to prepare the project structure and set up a dependency manager.
We will use `Maven` to handle our project dependencies and source code build.
Create a multi-module maven project in `IntelliJ Idea,` with such modules:
1. OnlineStore (this is the parent module)
2. domain
3. store
4. consoleApp
